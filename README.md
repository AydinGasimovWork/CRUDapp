# CRUDapp
CRUD app with incomplete front-end

`In the current state, the back-end and front-end are not connected`

`They will later be connected once the front-end is completed at a later time`

### How to use

1. Create the necessary database using the createDatabase.sql file found in the main directory
2. Go to server -> index.js and configure the mysql.createConnection() to your own database's configuration
3. Run the node application by typing "node index.js" or "nodemon index.js" in a cmd or bash terminal

> The application is configured to use port:3000 by default, but can be changed by editing the code or assigning new environment variable
